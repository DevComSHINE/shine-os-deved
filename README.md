## ShineOS+ Developer Edition SDK


SHINE stands for Secured Health Information Network and Exchange. A web and mobile-based system that addresses the data management needs of doctors, nurses, midwives, and other allied health professionals in the Philippines. We developed ShineOS+ as an opensource application under the GPL/LPL license, to encourage a community of developers and health industry experts to come together and build an ecology of healthcare technologies.

The Developer Edition is the software development kit (SDK) for ShineOS+.
